# GCC — Git Context Controller

> Structured, versioned memory for LLM agents. GCC gives agents persistent context using git-like operations: COMMIT milestones, BRANCH experiments, MERGE results, and recover CONTEXT across sessions.

GCC solves the problem of stateless LLM agents. Without structured memory, agents lose critical decisions behind token limits, can't safely experiment, sessions don't connect, and handoff between agents is impossible.

Agents operate through an Observation-Thought-Action (OTA) cycle. Every meaningful decision is logged and recoverable. The agent observes state, thinks about strategy, acts on the plan, then persists progress.

Everything lives under a `.GCC/` directory — human-readable, version-controlled, and inspectable. The file structure includes `main.md` (roadmap), `metadata.yaml` (project state), `commit.md` (commit history), `log.md` (OTA execution log), and `branches/` (isolated workspaces).

Four composable commands cover the full lifecycle of agent memory:

- **COMMIT**: Persist a milestone with full technical context — reasoning, files touched, and branch purpose. Triggers: `/gcc commit`, "save this", "checkpoint".
- **BRANCH**: Create an isolated workspace for experimentation without polluting the main flow. Triggers: `/gcc branch`, "try alternative", "experiment with".
- **MERGE**: Synthesize a completed branch back into main — what was tried, learned, and integrated. Triggers: `/gcc merge`, "integrate results", "branch is done".
- **CONTEXT**: Retrieve historical memory at any resolution — from high-level roadmap to fine-grained OTA traces. Triggers: `/gcc context`, "where were we?", "show history".

GCC is open source (MIT license), backed by peer-reviewed research, and works with Claude Code or any agent framework.
